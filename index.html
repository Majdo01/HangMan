    <h1>How to play the Hangman</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    A hidden word is chosen at the start of the game.<br>
      <br>
    Your goal is to guess the word one letter at a time.<br>
      <br>
    Click a letter to make a guess.<br>
      <br>
    If the letter is in the word, it will appear in its correct position.<br>
      <br>
    If the letter is not in the word, you lose one life and part of the hangman is drawn.<br>
      <br>
    Keep guessing letters before you run out of lives.<br>
      <br>
    You win if you reveal the full word.<br>
      <br>
    You lose if the hangman drawing is completed first.<br>
    <br>
    Your score displays under the hangman.<br>
